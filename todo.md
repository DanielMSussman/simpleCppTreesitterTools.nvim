# Global to-do list

## reasonable priority

have main functions return the stuff they'll write (for testing), and have an option that says "we're just testing...do everything except the write-to-file parts"

write doc / tutorial page


## reasonably low priority

more sophisticated alternate file (hxx,cxx,etc)

rule of 3 / 5? Just use or look at [nvim-treesitter-cpp-tools](https://github.com/Badhi/nvim-treesitter-cpp-tools). That's probably good advice for all of the functionality in this plugin.
