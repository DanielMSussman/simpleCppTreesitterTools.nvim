This plugin helps you to push a bunch of maps on some event, and then
pop them when you're done with that event. See examples below:

                                                             *cppTools.implementEverythingInClass()*
cppTools.implementEverythingInClass()

    if your cursor is inside a class definition in a header file, create (if needed) an implementation file in the same directory, and put an implementation stub in that cpp file
